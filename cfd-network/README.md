This Capstone Project was done to create the Certified Fabric Developer Network (CFDN) using the "Build Your First Network (BYFN)" example that came with the fabric-samples.git.

In this Project:
1) Network "BYFN" has been replaced by "CFDN"
2) Organization "Org1" has been replaced by "Comp1"
3) Organization "Org2" has been replaced by "Comp2"

After cloning this repository, put the "cfd-network" folder in the fabric-samples folder (i.e. same level as first-network)

This Capstone Project was successfully tested on an Oracle VM VirtualBox with:
- Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS 
- Docker CE 18.03.0-ce, build 0520e24
- Docker Compose 1.20.1, build 5d8c71b
- Node.js 8.11.1
- NPM 5.8
- Go 1.10.1 linux/amd64
- Hyperledger Fabric 1.1
- Java JDK 8 specifically 1.8.0_162
- Gradle 4.6

To keep things "lean", the folders/files related to creating the 3rd Organization (e.g. eyfn.sh, etc.) has been removed.

Below is the original README.md data...
